Home security app that launched with the first Apple Watch.

Got invited by Apple to test on pre-release Apple Watch hardware so the app would be ready on launch day. App is out of date now as it uses the non-native app version of WatchKit.

The app allows you to track the doors, windows, and appliances before going to bed. As you walk around the house at night checking things are locked and powered down, you check them off easily on the watch. The user gets the completion green check house and can rest assured as they go to sleep that all is well.
